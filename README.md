# COVID-19-Insights-Data-Exploration-and-Visualization

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data from Our Word in Data to gain insights into the infection and vaccination rates across different countries and continents. The analysis aims to understand the impact of the pandemic and visualize the data trends using Tableau.

## Tools Used
SQL, Tableau

## Data Sources
The data for this project was obtained from Our Word in Data. 

## Database Schema
The SQL database contains the following tables:
- `CovidDeaths`
- `CovidVaccinations`

## SQL Analysis
The following SQL queries were used to analyze the COVID-19 data:
- Calculating the death rate in the UK
- Calculating the infection rate for each country.
- Identifying countries with the highest infection rates and death counts
- Continent and Global numbers - total cases, total deaths, death rate
- Calculating the rolling count of daily vaccinations for each country and rolling vaccination percentage.

## Data Visualizations
Data visualizations are generated using Tableau based on the SQL analysis. 
You can view the interactive Tableau visualization at [Tableau Public - Covid-19 Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chloe.ta2127/viz/Covid-19Dashboard_16902137457150/Dashboard1).
